## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Gabriel Caro Esposito 

--Education/Experience--

* As a Junior Business Analyst with a passion for solving complex business challenges with strong foundation in data-driven decision-making solutions, I am confident in my ability to take the next step forward in helping organizations unlock insights and optimize business processes to drive growth and efficiency. 
 
* This began with a comprehensive education from TripleTen that offered hands-on experience in the field, where I obtained the skills to combine analytical expertise with a strategic mindset to deliver actionable solutions. 

* During the program, I worked along side tutors with BIA experience, as well as fellow students, to tackle real-world business cases. Diving deep into the skill sets for SQL, Data Visualization, Advanced Spread Sheets, Power BI, Tableau, and now currently Python, I was able to complete 7 projects with the accuracy to solve complex business problems, with more projects on the way.

--About Me--

Outside of my professional pursuits, I enjoy traveling. I am currently preparing for a temporary relocation to Milan, Italy. There I will be attending a private school to challenge myself in learning a new language.

In my free time, I actively do research on companies for personal investments in the New York Stock Exchange. For more than 5 years, I have been passionate about investments. Listening to Senior Stock Analysts over the years, I have learned so much about what makes a business an attractive business. Because of this, I have found an interest in being part of the changes necessary to make a business strive in this competitive economy.
